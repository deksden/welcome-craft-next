# ✨ Report for Task #28: UI Fixes and Enhancements ✨

**Branch:** `fix/28-ui-updates` (proposed)

## 📜 Summary of Work Done

This task involved addressing several UI issues in the application, specifically related to the theme switcher and user avatar display. All changes were made in accordance with the project standards outlined in `docs/RULEZZ.md`.

---

### 🎨 1. Theme Switcher Highlight (Issue: Not highlighting current theme)

*   **Problem:** The theme switcher UI in the toolbar (light/dark/system) was not visually indicating the currently selected theme.
*   **Solution:**
    *   🕵️‍♀️ Investigated `components/theme-switcher.tsx` and its underlying toggle component `components/ui/toggle.tsx`.
    *   🔧 Modified `components/ui/toggle.tsx` (`toggleVariants` for the `outline` variant) to provide a more distinct visual style for the selected item (`data-[state=on]`). The selected item now uses `bg-primary`, `text-primary-foreground`, and `border-primary` for clear highlighting.
    *   ✅ This ensures the active theme is always clearly visible in the `ThemeSwitcher`.
*   **Files Modified:**
    *   `components/ui/toggle.tsx`: Logic and style changes for selected state, JSDoc updated.
    *   `components/theme-switcher.tsx`: JSDoc updated to reflect dependency changes.
*   **Result:** The current theme selection is now clearly highlighted. 👍

### 👤 2. User Avatar Display (Issue: Avatar not visible, "dark spot")

*   **Problem:** The user avatar icon in the toolbar was not visible, appearing as a "dark spot".
*   **Solution:**
    *   🛠 Refactored `components/sidebar-user-nav.tsx` to make avatar display more robust.
    *   🖼 The component now attempts to load avatars in the following order:
        1.  `user.image` (if provided by the authentication provider).
        2.  `https://avatar.vercel.sh/${user.email}` (as a fallback).
    *   🆘 Implemented an `onError` handler for the `next/image` component. If both `user.image` and the Vercel avatar fail to load, the component now displays the user's initials (e.g., "JD" for "John Doe" or "U" for "user@example.com").
    *   ✍️ The initials are generated from `user.name` (preferring first and last name initials, or first two letters of a single name) or `user.email` (first letter).
    *   ℹ️ Enhanced the dropdown menu to display `user.name` (if available) instead of the generic "My Account" text.
*   **Files Modified:**
    *   `components/sidebar-user-nav.tsx`: Implemented new avatar loading logic, initials fallback, JSDoc updated.
*   **Result:** A user avatar or initials are now reliably displayed. ✅

### 📏 3. Compliance with Project Standards (`docs/RULEZZ.md`)

*   📝 All modified files (`components/ui/toggle.tsx`, `components/theme-switcher.tsx`, `components/sidebar-user-nav.tsx`) have been updated to meet project standards:
    *   Correct JSDoc headers (including `@version`, `@date`, `@updated`, and `HISTORY`).
    *   Standard end-of-file markers (`// END OF: ...`).
*   No other files were affected beyond those directly related to the task.
